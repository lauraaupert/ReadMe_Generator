## DESCRIPTION

This program generates README.md files. It uses the Inquirer npm and asks the user questions through Node.js. It then fills out the main sections of the README.md that will be published on GitHub. The sections, as well as the table of contents, are dynamically generated depending on user input. This very README.md file is being generated by the code in this repo.     
#### Technology used: Javascript, NodeJS, Package.json, npm inquirer.
