## INSTALLATION <a name="INSTALLATION"></a>

You should start by scooting all the way down to Madagascar, and hope for the best.
 
## USAGE <a name="USAGE"></a>

To use my penguins, you'd definitely have to be on my favorites list. 
 
## CONTRIBUTIONS <a name="CONTRIBUTIONS"></a>

I'd rather you don't contribute. This is very personal. Penguins get scared.

## TESTING <a name="TESTING"></a>

If you MUST test this, bring mayo. Penguin wings are rather bland.
